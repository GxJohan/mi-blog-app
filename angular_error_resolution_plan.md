# Plan to Resolve Angular Application Errors & Document Codebase Differences

This document outlines the plan used to diagnose and fix errors in the Angular application, and highlights key differences between the current codebase and the provided HTML manual.

## Initial Errors & Resolutions:

1.  **HTML Parsing Error in [`src/index.html`](src/index.html:1):**
    *   **Error:** `Unable to parse HTML; parse5 error code misplaced-doctype`
    *   **Cause:** The `<!doctype html>` declaration was incorrectly placed after `<link>` tags.
    *   **Resolution:** Moved `<!doctype html>` to the first line and ensured all `<link>` tags for CSS (Bootstrap, Font Awesome) are within the `<head>` section.

2.  **Template Syntax Errors in [`blog-viewer.component.html`](src/app/components/blog-viewer/blog-viewer.component.html:1-101):**
    *   **Error:** "Unrecognized block @." on line 61, column 67.
    *   **Cause:** The `@` symbol in `(@{{ selectedPost.author.username }})` was misinterpreted by the Angular template parser.
    *   **Resolution:** Changed to `(&commat;{{ selectedPost.author.username }})` using the HTML entity for `@`.

3.  **Component Declaration Mismatch & Unknown Element (`BlogViewerComponent`):**
    *   **Error 1:** "Component `BlogViewerComponent` is standalone, and cannot be declared in an NgModule. Did you mean to import it instead?"
    *   **Error 2:** "'app-blog-viewer' is not a known element" in [`app.component.html`](src/app/app.component.html:15).
    *   **Cause:** Despite `angular.json` setting `schematics.@schematics/angular:component.standalone` to `false`, Angular 19 (version `^19.2.0` in `package.json`) was treating the component as standalone. This led to missing directive errors (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `ngModel`).
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Explicitly made [`BlogViewerComponent`](src/app/components/blog-viewer/blog-viewer.component.ts:9) standalone by adding `standalone: true` to its decorator.
        *   Added necessary `imports: [CommonModule, FormsModule]` to `BlogViewerComponent`.
        *   Updated [`AppModule`](src/app/app.module.ts:1) to `import` `BlogViewerComponent` instead of `declare` it.

4.  **Runtime TypeError in [`blog-viewer.component.ts`](src/app/components/blog-viewer/blog-viewer.component.ts:31):**
    *   **Error:** `TypeError: this.searchId.trim is not a function`
    *   **Cause:** The `searchId` input field in [`blog-viewer.component.html`](src/app/components/blog-viewer/blog-viewer.component.html:16) has `type="number"`. This caused Angular's `ngModel` to bind a numeric value to `this.searchId`, while the component code expected a string and tried to call `.trim()` on it.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Changed the type of `this.searchId` in [`blog-viewer.component.ts`](src/app/components/blog-viewer/blog-viewer.component.ts:15) from `string` to `string | number`.
        *   In the [`onSearchPost()`](src/app/components/blog-viewer/blog-viewer.component.ts:28) method, explicitly converted `this.searchId` to a string using `String(this.searchId)` before calling `.trim()`.

## Key Differences: Codebase vs. HTML Manual

This section is for an LLM to understand the discrepancies and update the main HTML manual accordingly, focusing *only* on what's currently in the codebase.

1.  **Component Architecture:**
    *   **Codebase:** Uses **Standalone Components**. [`BlogViewerComponent`](src/app/components/blog-viewer/blog-viewer.component.ts:9) is `standalone: true` and imports `CommonModule` and `FormsModule` directly. [`AppModule`](src/app/app.module.ts:1) *imports* `BlogViewerComponent`.
    *   **Manual:** Describes a **NgModule-based architecture** (`--standalone false` during project/component generation), where components are declared in `AppModule`.
    *   **Action for LLM:** The manual's sections on "Paso 1: Preparar el Proyecto" (regarding `--standalone false`), "Paso 2: Configurar MÃ³dulos Necesarios" (AppModule setup), and "Paso 4: Crear el Componente de Blog" (generation and AppModule declaration) need to be updated to reflect the standalone component approach used in the current codebase.

2.  **HTML Structure (`index.html`):**
    *   **Codebase:** The initial `src/index.html` had a misplaced `<!doctype html>` which was corrected. The corrected version places `<!doctype html>` first, followed by `<html>`, then `<head>` containing meta tags and CSS links (Bootstrap, Font Awesome).
    *   **Manual:** The manual's "Paso 1" shows adding Bootstrap and Font Awesome links but doesn't highlight potential structural issues or the exact corrected order if `<!doctype html>` was initially misplaced.
    *   **Action for LLM:** Ensure the manual's `index.html` example in "Paso 1" is presented with the `<!doctype html>` correctly at the very beginning, before any other tags, and that `<link>` tags are within `<head>`.

3.  **Input Handling (`searchId`):**
    *   **Codebase:** The `searchId` input is `type="number"`. The component's `searchId` property is typed as `string | number`, and the `onSearchPost` method converts it to a string using `String()` before trimming. This was a fix for a `TypeError`.
    *   **Manual:** The `blog-viewer.component.ts` in "Paso 4" declares `searchId: string = '';` and directly uses `this.searchId.trim()`. The HTML for the input also shows `type="number"`. This combination would lead to the `TypeError` that was fixed in the codebase.
    *   **Action for LLM:** The manual's `blog-viewer.component.ts` (Paso 4) needs to be updated:
        *   Change `searchId: string = '';` to `searchId: string | number = '';`
        *   In `onSearchPost()`, change `if (!this.searchId.trim() || ...)` to `const searchValue = String(this.searchId); if (!searchValue.trim() || ...)`, and use `searchValue` for `parseInt()`.

4.  **Functionality Scope:**
    *   **Codebase:** The application **only allows viewing and searching existing posts** from JSONPlaceholder (get post by ID, get recent posts). It does *not* have functionality to create, update, or delete posts.
    *   **Manual:** The "Ejercicios Adicionales" section suggests adding features like comments, filtering by user, and pagination. It does *not* explicitly mention creating posts, but the user's query implied a desire for it.
    *   **Action for LLM:** The manual's introduction and conclusion should accurately reflect that the *base implementation* focuses on reading/viewing posts. If creation/editing is to be added as an *extension* or *exercise*, it should be clearly framed as such, and not implied as part of the initial build. The current codebase does not implement these.

## Current Application State:

*   The application successfully fetches and displays posts from JSONPlaceholder.
*   Users can search for a post by ID (1-100).
*   Users can view a list of recent posts.
*   The UI includes Bootstrap styling and Font Awesome icons.
*   All previously identified parsing and runtime errors have been resolved.
*   The application is built using Angular 19 with standalone components.
